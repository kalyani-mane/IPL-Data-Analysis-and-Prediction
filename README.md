# IPL-Data-Analysis-and-Prediction
End-to-end IPL Data Analysis and Prediction project using Python — includes EDA, visualization, and machine learning models (2008–2024).

## Project Overview
- This project was developed as part of my final year MCA (2025) coursework. 
- It focuses on analyzing IPL datasets from 2008–2024 to identify performance trends 
- and build predictive models for match outcomes using Python and machine learning techniques.

## 📊 Objectives
- Analyze team and player performance trends.
- Identify venue-based winning patterns.
- Build predictive models for match outcomes.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📈 Key Insights
- Certain venues and toss outcomes significantly influence match results.
- Team composition and batting-first advantage vary by year.
